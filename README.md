# EXAMPLE PROJECT #
I have created this project to learn NestJs, and practice my Frontend skills with Vite, along with getting 
comfortable with MaterialUI. 

## Planned Implementations ##
- [ ] Connect NestJS to a database (Probably MongoDB for efficiency)
- [ ] Implement a smooth Login/Registration page
- [x] Authorization & JWT 
- [ ] Use MaterialUI ["React Charts"](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/) for Data Display

_This project has gone stale, and will probably be deleted_
